# Nurse Conducting System
# This project has been done throughout CSE499A & CSE499B (CAPSTONE)
Summery: The proposed system is an IoT based real-time wireless nurse conducting system consisting of 3 majors parts : nurse calling device, local server and wireless wristband. A patient can call upon a nurse for an emergency case and the notification will be received in the nurse's wrist band.  Most of the existing emergency calling system in the hospitals are based on hard-wired solution and a terminal which is a costly approach. The wireless solution that exists today is based on pager technology which is another costly approach. This project is based on a unified WiFi network which highly accessible and cheap to find thus making it one of the most minimalist approaches in this domain. The key component of this project is a microcontroller-based WiFi module ESP8266 and a local Server. This project can be used in any kind of scale depending on the need. This project promises to deliver much higher performance and coverage while it is closing the gap between the management and workers by monitoring calls real-time.
